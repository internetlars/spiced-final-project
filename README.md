# spiced-final-project

My final project for Spiced Academy; an app that allows users to see how much traffic there currently is in public basketball courts in the vicinity. Fully functional geolocalization and check-in functionality implemented using MapBox API, React JS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Javascript, CSS and HTML.
